This is a private project, I just want to review/restudy some c# fundational function. But if you also want to reuse the c# 
and intersted in coding,  you can fork this. :)
Right now, I have following thread want to review it:
1, Delegate
2, Thread
3, MSIL
4, Design Pattern
....

may update this README if I had reviewed .
